       "825   Uses a LOT of expensive ink cartridges! Reason, the cartridges are tiny compared to the 4630. Cartridges are ludicrously expensive for what they are. Even the XL versions do not last. I have tried to use Epson for many years. They start out ok, but if they have to sit awhile while one is gone for a couple weeks, the ink dries in the jets and no amount of cleaning will fix it. So I thought I would try this less expensive version. Then the cartridge cost. I think I will be looking for a laser printer next time   \n",
