       "6179  I switched from HP to Canon. This printer prints well and offers affordable subscription plans. It is very easy to set up if you follow the instructions in the box and on the screen. I like the fact that it has wireless connection. The printer prints fast but 'moves'. The quality of the photos is excellent. It prints well on papers as well, but depending on the picture quality or paper quality, it sometimes prints papers as bluish with gray. As a student, I use it mostly for printing research papers.   \n",

I did this for an hour, had my wife and son talk into the phone and apparently my model number TR4720 does not exist, even though I have it in front of me.Bottom line if you need customer support you best figure it out on your own because nobody is there to help you.Lets see how long the paper tray holds up, maybe a month or so?

For 1. when not in use it shuts down completely.  I don’t know how long it stays idle before shutting down and there’s no way to find out because it’s not in the manual nor can you call customer support without having an account and providing your email and phone number. I also tried to call customer support to get an answer of is a Google Chromebook compatible? It does not appear to be but that is not listed anywhere in the instructions and again, I can’t speak to anyone in customer support unless I create an account. It took me awhile to set it up wirelessly but I succeeded and have printed from my iPhone a few times, but the Chromebook is a no go.   \n",

       "738   Very fragile and flimsy printer. I had a simple question for Customer support and it took me an hour to get through. Finally I found out I had to register the product in order to even talk to someone.  When you try to register online they ask you for your product through voice recognition. I said my model 3 times and they don't recognize my model number and hang up on you. I did this for an hour, had my wife and son talk into the phone and apparently my model number TR4720 does not exist, even though I have it in front of me.Bottom line if you need customer support you best figure it out on your own because nobody is there to help you.Lets see how long the paper tray holds up, maybe a month or so? I think a piece of tape to hold it together would be better.I will be returning this printer.   \n",

       "3330   Returning this. For 1. when not in use it shuts down completely.  I don’t know how long it stays idle before shutting down and there’s no way to find out because it’s not in the manual nor can you call customer support without having an account and providing your email and phone number. I also tried to call customer support to get an answer of is a Google Chromebook compatible? It does not appear to be but that is not listed anywhere in the instructions and again, I can’t speak to anyone in customer support unless I create an account. It took me awhile to set it up wirelessly but I succeeded and have printed from my iPhone a few times, but the Chromebook is a no go.   \n",
       "6289                                         I received my first printer and kept getting an error saying \"insert paper cassette correctly\". I am no novice to printers but I called customer support because no matter what I did it wasn't working. Customer support determined it was a software problem and to replace the unit. I did so and received my new one. Yayyy, I finally have a printer after months of back ordering and running to UPS for my print jobs. Nope, this one had the exact same issue, and I was told the exact same thing by customer support.Apparently this is a new model that was just released and they haven't worked out the bugs yet. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRINTER.   \n",
