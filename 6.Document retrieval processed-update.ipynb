       "6179  I switched from HP to Canon. This printer prints well and offers affordable subscription plans. It is very easy to set up if you follow the instructions in the box and on the screen. I like the fact that it has wireless connection. The printer prints fast but 'moves'. The quality of the photos is excellent. It prints well on papers as well, but depending on the picture quality or paper quality, it sometimes prints papers as bluish with gray. As a student, I use it mostly for printing research papers.   \n",

I've tried different papers - thinner, thicker - it doesn't matter. It prints 2 pages and then jams - prints 2 more and jams. It partially prints and says it's jammed and ended up wasting over 30 pieces of paper trying to print an 11 page document.   \n",
       "1473           This printer is awful. Just after the return window was closed, it stopped working! It tries to suck up too many papers at once and jams every single time I print more than one sheet. I had high hopes for this printer, but it was just a waste of money. I'm super disappointed! I have even tried different brands of paper but it still jams. It prints blurry, but I'm not sure if that's from being a crappy printer or from wrestling jammed paper out of it all the time. Either way, avoid this one!!   \n",

I said my model 3 times and they don't recognize my model number and hang up on you. I did this for an hour, had my wife and son talk into the phone and apparently my model number TR4720 does not exist, even though I have it in front of me.Bottom line if you need customer support you best figure it out on your own because nobody is there to help you.Lets see how long the paper tray holds up, maybe a month or so?

For 1. when not in use it shuts down completely.  I don’t know how long it stays idle before shutting down and there’s no way to find out because it’s not in the manual nor can you call customer support without having an account and providing your email and phone number. I also tried to call customer support to get an answer of is a Google Chromebook compatible? It does not appear to be but that is not listed anywhere in the instructions and again, I can’t speak to anyone in customer support unless I create an account. It took me awhile to set it up wirelessly but I succeeded and have printed from my iPhone a few times, but the Chromebook is a no go.   \n",

       "738   Very fragile and flimsy printer. I had a simple question for Customer support and it took me an hour to get through. Finally I found out I had to register the product in order to even talk to someone.  When you try to register online they ask you for your product through voice recognition. I said my model 3 times and they don't recognize my model number and hang up on you. I did this for an hour, had my wife and son talk into the phone and apparently my model number TR4720 does not exist, even though I have it in front of me.Bottom line if you need customer support you best figure it out on your own because nobody is there to help you.Lets see how long the paper tray holds up, maybe a month or so? I think a piece of tape to hold it together would be better.I will be returning this printer.   \n",

       "3330   Returning this. For 1. when not in use it shuts down completely.  I don’t know how long it stays idle before shutting down and there’s no way to find out because it’s not in the manual nor can you call customer support without having an account and providing your email and phone number. I also tried to call customer support to get an answer of is a Google Chromebook compatible? It does not appear to be but that is not listed anywhere in the instructions and again, I can’t speak to anyone in customer support unless I create an account. It took me awhile to set it up wirelessly but I succeeded and have printed from my iPhone a few times, but the Chromebook is a no go.   \n",
       "6289                                         I received my first printer and kept getting an error saying \"insert paper cassette correctly\". I am no novice to printers but I called customer support because no matter what I did it wasn't working. Customer support determined it was a software problem and to replace the unit. I did so and received my new one. Yayyy, I finally have a printer after months of back ordering and running to UPS for my print jobs. Nope, this one had the exact same issue, and I was told the exact same thing by customer support.Apparently this is a new model that was just released and they haven't worked out the bugs yet. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRINTER.   \n",

However, when setting up the printer and installing the software for Mac users, it doesn’t always install smoothly and corrupts. The scanner software for installation says to install smart, scan software, but actually that’s the wrong software. It should be scan 2 software, which also corrupts and doesn’t completely install all the time. EPSON technical support is terrible. I can’t say it’s even close to acceptable. There is a big English problem of understanding each other, their phone lines being overseas for north Americans always has a bad connection and will disconnect during your conversation. The technicians don’t know what they’re doing and do not know their products and are constantly putting you on hold to talk to somebody by computer in the USA to try and solve the problems you’re calling about. EPSON really needs to get their act together and bring back English-speaking technical support.</td>\n",

       "2343  The printer seems like a reasonable printer for the price and once it’s set up performs reasonably well. However, when setting up the printer and installing the software for Mac users, it doesn’t always install smoothly and corrupts. The scanner software for installation says to install smart, scan software, but actually that’s the wrong software. It should be scan 2 software, which also corrupts and doesn’t completely install all the time. EPSON technical support is terrible. I can’t say it’s even close to acceptable. There is a big English problem of understanding each other, their phone lines being overseas for north Americans always has a bad connection and will disconnect during your conversation. The technicians don’t know what they’re doing and do not know their products and are constantly putting you on hold to talk to somebody by computer in the USA to try and solve the problems you’re calling about. EPSON really needs to get their act together and bring back English-speaking technical support.   \n",

Then different directions said I have to restart my router, my computer and my printer and do a few other steps just to set it back up with the wifi. The directions for support are super confusing and wordy. They also use ambiguous language and do not specify what things are, so someone who is not very tech savvy would most likely be confused trying to trouble shoot. I do not always have the option to call someone so I would prefer to trouble shoot myself, which is a very lengthy process with this printer. I also noticed that there were a lot pages that had issues with the ink after printing out three pages. This printer is great if you have three hours to trouble shoot reconnecting to wifi.</td>\n",

Setup was annoyingly complex luckily I researched the HP+ & watched reviews (not my thing so I opted NOT to enroll - important to know details before enrolling) But the instant ink program - its terrific hope they don’t ruin it🥴 overall it’s a spunky mid size printer good enough for the typical home office🥴☀️🔆   \n",

Paid a little more up front than an equivalent printer with the throw away types of cartridges, but will save hundreds a year with the tank system. No longer miserly with what I print by trying to find the absolute lowest possible ink usage settings and always in b&w. I can print from my macbooks, iphone, ipad easy breezy. They've done a great job engineering the ink filling process and it's completely mess free.   \n",
       "4  Not User Friendly You would think something as simple as reconnecting to the wifi would be easy. Nope. First I had to reset wifi and let the printer sit for two hours. seriously? Then different directions said I have to restart my router, my computer and my printer and do a few other steps just to set it back up with the wifi. The directions for support are super confusing and wordy. They also use ambiguous language and do not specify what things are, so someone who is not very tech savvy would most likely be confused trying to trouble shoot. I do not always have the option to call someone so I would prefer to trouble shoot myself, which is a very lengthy process with this printer. I also noticed that there were a lot pages that had issues with the ink after printing out three pages. This printer is great if you have three hours to trouble shoot reconnecting to wifi.   \n",

Setup was annoyingly complex luckily I researched the HP+ & watched reviews (not my thing so I opted NOT to enroll - important to know details before enrolling) But the instant ink program - its terrific hope they don’t ruin it🥴 overall it’s a spunky mid size printer good enough for the typical home office🥴☀️🔆   \n",

Paid a little more up front than an equivalent printer with the throw away types of cartridges, but will save hundreds a year with the tank system. No longer miserly with what I print by trying to find the absolute lowest possible ink usage settings and always in b&w. I can print from my macbooks, iphone, ipad easy breezy. They've done a great job engineering the ink filling process and it's completely mess free.   \n",
      "4      Not User Friendly You would think something as simple as reconnecting to the wifi would be easy. Nope. First I had to reset wifi and let the printer sit for two hours. seriously? Then different directions said I have to restart my router, my computer and my printer and do a few other steps just to set it back up with the wifi. The directions for support are super confusing and wordy. They also use ambiguous language and do not specify what things are, so someone who is not very tech savvy would most likely be confused trying to trouble shoot. I do not always have the option to call someone so I would prefer to trouble shoot myself, which is a very lengthy process with this printer. I also noticed that there were a lot pages that had issues with the ink after printing out three pages. This printer is great if you have three hours to trouble shoot reconnecting to wifi.   \n",
