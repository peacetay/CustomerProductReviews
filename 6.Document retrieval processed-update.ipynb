Paid a little more up front than an equivalent printer with the throw away types of cartridges, but will save hundreds a year with the tank system. No longer miserly with what I print by trying to find the absolute lowest possible ink usage settings and always in b&w. I can print from my macbooks, iphone, ipad easy breezy. They've done a great job engineering the ink filling process and it's completely mess free.\n",
       "4    Not User Friendly You would think something as simple as reconnecting to the wifi would be easy. Nope. First I had to reset wifi and let the printer sit for two hours. seriously? Then different directions said I have to restart my router, my computer and my printer and do a few other steps just to set it back up with the wifi. The directions for support are super confusing and wordy. They also use ambiguous language and do not specify what things are, so someone who is not very tech savvy would most likely be confused trying to trouble shoot. I do not always have the option to call someone so I would prefer to trouble shoot myself, which is a very lengthy process with this printer. I also noticed that there were a lot pages that had issues with the ink after printing out three pages. This printer is great if you have three hours to trouble shoot reconnecting to wifi.\n",

       "5691  If you print something? Paper jams. Reload the paper the only way it can go? Paper jam.WiFi blinks? Paper jam. You leave the printer alone too long? Paper jam. It’s incredible how hard it must be to make a printer that just prints when it’s told to, because no one can seem to do it. I’ve had this for 3 months and it’s a very high maintenance printer.   \n",

Fill the paper tray, use about 1/2 the paper in the tray, and bam…. A paper jam!Of course the jam is in the back of printer…. What a pain!!!I do not recommend this printer   \n",

It should be scan 2 software, which also corrupts and doesn’t completely install all the time. EPSON technical support is terrible. I can’t say it’s even close to acceptable. There is a big English problem of understanding each other, their phone lines being overseas for north Americans always has a bad connection and will disconnect during your conversation. The technicians don’t know what they’re doing and do not know their products and are constantly putting you on hold to talk to somebody by computer in the USA to try and solve the problems you’re calling about.

       "2343  The printer seems like a reasonable printer for the price and once it’s set up performs reasonably well. However, when setting up the printer and installing the software for Mac users, it doesn’t always install smoothly and corrupts. The scanner software for installation says to install smart, scan software, but actually that’s the wrong software. It should be scan 2 software, which also corrupts and doesn’t completely install all the time. EPSON technical support is terrible. I can’t say it’s even close to acceptable. There is a big English problem of understanding each other, their phone lines being overseas for north Americans always has a bad connection and will disconnect during your conversation. The technicians don’t know what they’re doing and do not know their products and are constantly putting you on hold to talk to somebody by computer in the USA to try and solve the problems you’re calling about. EPSON really needs to get their act together and bring back English-speaking technical support.   \n",

Fill the paper tray, use about 1/2 the paper in the tray, and bam…. A paper jam!Of course the jam is in the back of printer…. What a pain!!!I do not recommend this printer   \n",
       "1                                   This printer is horrible. it works when it wants to. Simple directions...put paper in under cassette, slide it in, print, Nope it gets stuck and paper does easily fit in. So use the paper tray at the top, nope paper jam everytime, or 30 sheets of paper on it and you get \" please put paper in tray. ended up chucking it   \n",
       "2  If you print something? Paper jams. Reload the paper the only way it can go? Paper jam.WiFi blinks? Paper jam. You leave the printer alone too long? Paper jam. It’s incredible how hard it must be to make a printer that just prints when it’s told to, because no one can seem to do it. I’ve had this for 3 months and it’s a very high maintenance printer.   \n",

       "2  Will never buy HP again!!!Bought printer.  After one month unable to print.  Called Amazon, sent me to HP tech support went through all of the steps there. 1.5 months later parts started falling off of the printer. Called Amazon back, now out of return window- sent back to Hp support. Sat on the phone for over and hour 6 different video chats.  Now I am being asked for my credit card # to replace the printer as an assurance policy.  Called Amazon back again. Now, the refund I get in miss a restocking fee. I am not happy with that so they will give a promotion fee to make up the difference of which does not actually show up on your account, they can only “see it” on their end.#brokenprinter, no a full refund!!!  Will never buy HP again!   \n",

I wanna know why I could not do a return through Kohls like most items purchased through Amazon? I had to take it to UPS and the only one closes was a point drop off point as I believe they called it. so I’m losing $5.99 off my return when I should have been able to return it free through Kohls   \n",
