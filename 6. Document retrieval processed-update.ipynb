       "6179  I switched from HP to Canon. This printer prints well and offers affordable subscription plans. It is very easy to set up if you follow the instructions in the box and on the screen. I like the fact that it has wireless connection. The printer prints fast but 'moves'. The quality of the photos is excellent. It prints well on papers as well, but depending on the picture quality or paper quality, it sometimes prints papers as bluish with gray. As a student, I use it mostly for printing research papers.   \n",

       "3330  Returning this. For 1. when not in use it shuts down completely.  I don’t know how long it stays idle before shutting down and there’s no way to find out because it’s not in the manual nor can you call customer support without having an account and providing your email and phone number. I also tried to call customer support to get an answer of is a Google Chromebook compatible? It does not appear to be but that is not listed anywhere in the instructions and again, I can’t speak to anyone in customer support unless I create an account. It took me awhile to set it up wirelessly but I succeeded and have printed from my iPhone a few times, but the Chromebook is a no go.   \n",

We called other brands disposable due to a lack of repair support.  I knew Canon was a brand that if I had any issues with, their customer support (although can be difficult to get hold of) will take care of the issue.  So far, the printer was easily set up, works great, and has great print quality.   \n",

       "3330  Returning this. For 1. when not in use it shuts down completely.  I don’t know how long it stays idle before shutting down and there’s no way to find out because it’s not in the manual nor can you call customer support without having an account and providing your email and phone number. I also tried to call customer support to get an answer of is a Google Chromebook compatible? It does not appear to be but that is not listed anywhere in the instructions and again, I can’t speak to anyone in customer support unless I create an account. It took me awhile to set it up wirelessly but I succeeded and have printed from my iPhone a few times, but the Chromebook is a no go.   \n",
       "6289                                        I received my first printer and kept getting an error saying \"insert paper cassette correctly\". I am no novice to printers but I called customer support because no matter what I did it wasn't working. Customer support determined it was a software problem and to replace the unit. I did so and received my new one. Yayyy, I finally have a printer after months of back ordering and running to UPS for my print jobs. Nope, this one had the exact same issue, and I was told the exact same thing by customer support.Apparently this is a new model that was just released and they haven't worked out the bugs yet. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRINTER.   \n",

We called other brands disposable due to a lack of repair support.  I knew Canon was a brand that if I had any issues with, their customer support (although can be difficult to get hold of) will take care of the issue.  So far, the printer was easily set up, works great, and has great print quality.   \n",
