Paid a little more up front than an equivalent printer with the throw away types of cartridges, but will save hundreds a year with the tank system. No longer miserly with what I print by trying to find the absolute lowest possible ink usage settings and always in b&w. I can print from my macbooks, iphone, ipad easy breezy. They've done a great job engineering the ink filling process and it's completely mess free.   \n",
       "4  You would think something as simple as reconnecting to the wifi would be easy. Nope. First I had to reset wifi and let the printer sit for two hours. seriously? Then different directions said I have to restart my router, my computer and my printer and do a few other steps just to set it back up with the wifi. The directions for support are super confusing and wordy. They also use ambiguous language and do not specify what things are, so someone who is not very tech savvy would most likely be confused trying to trouble shoot. I do not always have the option to call someone so I would prefer to trouble shoot myself, which is a very lengthy process with this printer. I also noticed that there were a lot pages that had issues with the ink after printing out three pages. This printer is great if you have three hours to trouble shoot reconnecting to wifi.   \n",

Paid a little more up front than an equivalent printer with the throw away types of cartridges, but will save hundreds a year with the tank system. No longer miserly with what I print by trying to find the absolute lowest possible ink usage settings and always in b&w. I can print from my macbooks, iphone, ipad easy breezy. They've done a great job engineering the ink filling process and it's completely mess free.   \n",
       "4  You would think something as simple as reconnecting to the wifi would be easy. Nope. First I had to reset wifi and let the printer sit for two hours. seriously? Then different directions said I have to restart my router, my computer and my printer and do a few other steps just to set it back up with the wifi. The directions for support are super confusing and wordy. They also use ambiguous language and do not specify what things are, so someone who is not very tech savvy would most likely be confused trying to trouble shoot. I do not always have the option to call someone so I would prefer to trouble shoot myself, which is a very lengthy process with this printer. I also noticed that there were a lot pages that had issues with the ink after printing out three pages. This printer is great if you have three hours to trouble shoot reconnecting to wifi.   \n",

Setup was annoyingly complex luckily I researched the HP+ & watched reviews (not my thing so I opted NOT to enroll - important to know details before enrolling) But the instant ink program - its terrific hope they don’t ruin it🥴 overall it’s a spunky mid size printer good enough for the typical home office🥴☀️🔆   \n",

Paid a little more up front than an equivalent printer with the throw away types of cartridges, but will save hundreds a year with the tank system. No longer miserly with what I print by trying to find the absolute lowest possible ink usage settings and always in b&w. I can print from my macbooks, iphone, ipad easy breezy. They've done a great job engineering the ink filling process and it's completely mess free.   \n",
       "4      You would think something as simple as reconnecting to the wifi would be easy. Nope. First I had to reset wifi and let the printer sit for two hours. seriously? Then different directions said I have to restart my router, my computer and my printer and do a few other steps just to set it back up with the wifi. The directions for support are super confusing and wordy. They also use ambiguous language and do not specify what things are, so someone who is not very tech savvy would most likely be confused trying to trouble shoot. I do not always have the option to call someone so I would prefer to trouble shoot myself, which is a very lengthy process with this printer. I also noticed that there were a lot pages that had issues with the ink after printing out three pages. This printer is great if you have three hours to trouble shoot reconnecting to wifi.   \n",

Setup was annoyingly complex luckily I researched the HP+ & watched reviews (not my thing so I opted NOT to enroll - important to know details before enrolling) But the instant ink program - its terrific hope they don’t ruin it🥴 overall it’s a spunky mid size printer good enough for the typical home office🥴☀️🔆   \n",

Paid a little more up front than an equivalent printer with the throw away types of cartridges, but will save hundreds a year with the tank system. No longer miserly with what I print by trying to find the absolute lowest possible ink usage settings and always in b&w. I can print from my macbooks, iphone, ipad easy breezy. They've done a great job engineering the ink filling process and it's completely mess free.   \n",
       "4      You would think something as simple as reconnecting to the wifi would be easy. Nope. First I had to reset wifi and let the printer sit for two hours. seriously? Then different directions said I have to restart my router, my computer and my printer and do a few other steps just to set it back up with the wifi. The directions for support are super confusing and wordy. They also use ambiguous language and do not specify what things are, so someone who is not very tech savvy would most likely be confused trying to trouble shoot. I do not always have the option to call someone so I would prefer to trouble shoot myself, which is a very lengthy process with this printer. I also noticed that there were a lot pages that had issues with the ink after printing out three pages. This printer is great if you have three hours to trouble shoot reconnecting to wifi.   \n",

       "4      you would think something as simple as reconnecting to the wifi would be easy nope first i had to reset wifi and let the printer sit for two hours seriously then different directions said i have to restart my router my computer and my printer and do a few other steps just to set it back up with the wifi the directions for support are super confusing and wordy they also use ambiguous language and do not specify what things are so someone who is not very tech savvy would most likely be confused trying to trouble shoot i do not always have the option to call someone so i would prefer to trouble shoot myself which is a very lengthy process with this printer i also noticed that there were a lot pages that had issues with the ink after printing out three pages this printer is great if you have three hours to trouble shoot reconnecting to wifi   \n",
